          <h3>Identification:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Analyzing File Behavior: For malware, ML algorithms monitor the behavior of programs for any anomalies, such as unauthorized file access, abnormal network communication, or unusual resource consumption, which could indicate the presence of malware.</li>
                <li>Static Code Analysis: This algorithm examines the structure of code to detect patterns and characteristics commonly found in malware.</li>
                <li>Behavioral Analysis: Models observe system behavior to identify deviations from normal patterns, signaling potential malware activity.</li>
                <li>Sandboxing: AI-powered sandboxes execute suspicious files in isolated environments, allowing analysis of their behavior without risking harm to the host system.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deep Learning:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Analyzing Malware Signatures: Deep learning techniques can identify new and previously unseen malware variants by analyzing underlying code structures and functionalities.</li>
                <li>Image Recognition: Deep learning models can detect malware concealed within images or other media files, enhancing detection capabilities.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Mitigation:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Automatic Quarantining:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>AI systems can automatically isolate infected files or systems to prevent further damage and halt the spread of malware across the network.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Alerting Security Personnel:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Set an alert notification which can be promptly sent to security teams when potential malware is detected, enabling them to investigate and respond to the threat effectively.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Patching Vulnerabilities:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>AI algorithms can identify vulnerabilities exploited by malware and recommend patches or configuration changes to address security weaknesses.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automated Remediation:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Under specific conditions, AI-driven systems can automate remediation actions, such as applying patches to vulnerable software or removing malware from infected systems, based on predefined rules and policies.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Implementing AI-based:</h3>
          <p>Machine Learning Algorithms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Random Forest: An ensemble learning method effective for detecting malware based on features extracted from files or system behaviors.</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm often used for malware detection by separating malicious and benign samples in feature space.</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression: A binary classification algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks in malware detection.</li>
            <li>Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Another ensemble learning technique suitable for detecting complex patterns in malware datasets.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Deep Learning Algorithms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Widely used for image recognition tasks and can be applied to malware detection, especially for identifying malware hidden within files or images.</li>
            <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Suited for sequential data processing and can be used to analyze system log data or network traffic for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of malware activity.</li>
